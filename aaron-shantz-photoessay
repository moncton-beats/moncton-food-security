This is where the story begins. I met Aaron at the Clementine Café on Elmwood in Moncton. I'm not sure if Elaine had met him before when she was working on her proposal for her City Farming Adventures -- Moncton project. I met Laura DeGrace of Green Eye Coop so perhaps it's green meeting area. It's a good spot for meeting. You can acutally hear the conversation. The acoustics are pretty good.
We talked for about an hour, trying to get to who Aaron is. The foundation of Moncton Beats is that we start with the person, not the organization so that we can better maintain perspective, keep the story vital. Lengthy descriptions of how an organization is put together make my eyes glaze over and then no communication -- or communing -- is going on.

Near the end of the interview I asked him to draw out a graphic of how food groups in the area are organized. That's what he's doing in the top photograph. Then I asked him which one was the most dear to his heart, but it turned out it was not on the graphic. It was his and his wife Shelley's own struggle to grow enough food for his family of four. They were trying to live the life they believed in, of being as gentle with the earth as they could while trying to make a living.

So this is where we started the photoessay, at their homestead in Ste Marie. It was a beautiful sunny September morning. It was fall but beautiful and still easy to not think that winter was coming. When we got there Aaron and his oldest son Gryphon had obviously been up and out for a while. They came out of the woods and up to the house in an old pickup truck with the driver side door missing. It was a truck Shelley was a little embarrassed about, but most men would appreciate its value, both as a tool and just fun to have. 

A serious, hearty garden at harvest time is great for photography. Everything was lush and there was plenty to talk about because gardening naturally leads to storytelling. There is the hope and dreams at the beginning of the season, the tension as weather and pests of different sorts, those great events when real food starts getting picked and eaten. It all seems free and magical once it's on the plate.
